# Wakify - an app matching your mood to a playlist

Produced by Lili, Guille, Moses, Jonas as part of the Makers Bootcamp

 
 About
 
 Our app allows the user to find a playlist that matches their mood. Wakify use the Spotiy API to search their log of playlist to match with how you are feeling. This app is in development. It currently runs on Expo Go using ReactNative. If you'd like to try this app or develop it futher feel free to scroll down to get started.

 # Our Team
