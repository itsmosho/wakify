 About
 
 Our app allows the user to find a playlist that matches their mood. Wakify use the Spotiy API to search their log of playlist to match with how you are feeling. This app is in development. It currently runs on Expo Go using ReactNative. If you'd like to try this app or develop it futher feel free to scroll down to get started.

 # Our Team 

 We are all Makers Bootcamp students, creating our final project. We had 2 weeks to develop this app and decide on out apps functionality. During our course we learnt Ruby,SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript so learing react native whilst creating an app was a rewarding learning curve and experience. To manage our tickets we used Trello and regularly has checkins and retros .

## Design
Our initial app design looked like this 
![alt text](https://github.com/jonas-diete/wakify/blob/authorise-button/readme.img/initial-design.png?raw=true)

The current build of the app is similar to this design. The only changes are for the handling of data.
Since Expo Go is not compatible with MongoDB we have opted to use AsyncStorage, and there are no model files either.

## Dependencies

- Expo go 
- Expo auth session
- Expo notifications
- Expo webpack/web browser
- React Native
- Spotify web api node
- AsyncStorage
## Testing
- For unit testing we used Jest
- For end-to-end testing we used Cypress
